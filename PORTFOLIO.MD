## 3. About Me (Long-Form)

I am currently pursuing an **MEng in Computer Science at University College London**, where I hold a **First Class average** and have been awarded a **100% Undergraduate Global Merit Scholarship**. My academic and professional journey is driven by a deep interest in **bridging machine learning research with deployable, real-world systems**.

My core strengths lie in **AI systems engineering**, **backend and full-stack development**, and **robotics**, with a strong emphasis on **clean architecture, scalability, and reliability**. I am particularly interested in how **large language models, retrieval systems, and intelligent agents** can be integrated responsibly into real products — not just as demos, but as robust tools used by real users.

Alongside my academic work, I have contributed to **industry-scale projects**, including the development of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with Hewlett-Packard** and the **end-to-end build of a global EdTech and AI platform (Sapiens Nova Academy)** that supports international programmes, secure payments, and AI-powered assistance.

I enjoy operating at the intersection of **research and engineering** — applying theoretical concepts from machine learning, robotics, and systems design to solve practical problems. Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my expertise in **applied ML systems, robotics-integrated intelligence, and AI research**, with strong interest in **research-oriented roles and future PhD study**.
